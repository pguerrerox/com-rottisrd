# Website development

Repository dedicated to the development of the website `https://www.rottisrd.com.do`.

### Technologies

- HTML - CSS - JS, the usual suspects.
- Vue.js
- Nuxt.js  ~~Gridsome~~ 

Happy coding!

### Challenges <sub>nuxt.js</sub>
- 


```bash
gridsome...
- Fetching data from a json file
- Using the gridsome tag <g-image> together with Vue directive <v-for>    
- Problems generating pages or loading, not sure
    1.  Found info related to this problem on the gridsome documentacion. Turns out that gridsome will not generate all the dynamically generated pages (which is very inteligent).
    https://gridsome.org/docs/dynamic-routing/#generating-rewrite-rules
        
gave up on this.
