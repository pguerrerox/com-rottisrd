# Website development

Repository dedicated to the development of the website `https://www.rottisrd.com.do`. 

### Technologies

- HTML - CSS - JS, the usual suspects.
- Vue
- Gridsome

Happy coding!

### Challenges

1. **Fetching data from a json file**

2. **Using the gridsome tag <g-image> together with Vue directive <v-for>**

3. **Problems generating pages or loading, not sure**
   
   1. Found info related to this problem on the gridsome documentacion. Turns out that gridsome will not generate all the dynamically generated pages (which is very inteligent).
